# üìä Kimia Farma Business Analytics  

Kimia Farma is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in Indonesia, with branches spread across multiple provinces. To support data-driven decision-making, this project applies SQL for ***data cleaning, transformation, and business analytics***. The processed data is used to build analytical tables and answer key business questions, such as revenue trends, branch performance, discount effectiveness, and regional profitability.

## üöÄ Features  

- **Data Cleaning** ‚Üí Handle invalid values, trim strings, standardize formats  
- **Transformation** ‚Üí Build unified analytical table `tabel_analisa`  
- **Branch & Province Analysis** ‚Üí Identify top/bottom branches by profit and rating  
- **Product Analysis** ‚Üí Find products contributing the most profit  
- **Performance Indicators** ‚Üí Net Sales, Net Profit, Transaction Count, Ratings

2. Which **provinces** record the most **transactions**?  
3. Which **provinces** achieve the highest **net sales**?  
4. Are there **branches** with high **branch ratings** but low **transaction ratings**?
5. How is the distribution of ***total profit*** across ***provinces*** in Indonesia? 
6. What is Kimia Farma‚Äôs overall **performance** in terms of **sales**, **profit**, **customers**, and **transactions**?  
7. How does the **average discount** differ across **provinces**?  
8. What is the relationship between **profit** and **transaction count** per **branch**?  
9. Which **products** have the highest **purchase frequency**?

# üìñ Data Sources
There are four datasets used for analysis and stored in BigQuery:
- `kf_final_transaction` ‚Üí records of all transactions
- `kf_inventory` ‚Üí branch inventory data
- `kf_kantor_cabang` ‚Üí branch details and ratings
- `kf_product` ‚Üí product details and categories

Due to confidentiality, the datasets utilized in this project cannot be disclosed or shared publicly. Only the data structure and transformation process are presented for demonstration purposes

FROM `kimia_farma.kf_final_transaction` t
JOIN `kimia_farma.kf_kantor_cabang` b
ON t.branch_id = b.branch_id
JOIN `kimia_farma.kf_product` p
ON t.product_id = p.product_id;
```
From these sources, a central analytical table called tabel_analisa was created.
It integrates transactions, branches, and products to support BI and analytics.
